# ColorReader

Mostly just playing with image manipulation in Windows. Simple form on left to show an image. Double-click that to select a different image. Use buttons on bottom to select colors or set the fuzziness (how close to the color does it match). Click Set Color to see the modified image on right. Haven't added an ability to save the modified image yet.
